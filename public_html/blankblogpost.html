The Arhennius acid is defined as a compound that breaks up in water to give off hydronium ions (H+). Arhennius bases are defined as compounds that break apart into hydroxide ions (OH-). Bronsted-Lowry acids are compounds that are proton donors. Bronsted-Lowry bases are compounds that are proton acceptors. Finally, Lewis acids are compounds that are electron pair acceptors, and Lewis bases are electron pair donors.
