		<h2> Classification System</h2>
		<p> 	We use three ways in particular to define acids and bases: the <b>Arhennius</b> definition (the least broad), the <b>Bronsted-Lowry</b> definition (the middle), and the <b>Lewis</b> definition(the most accurate). The Arhennius acid is defined as a compound that breaks up in water to give off hydronium ions (H+). Arhennius bases are defined as compounds that break apart into hydroxide ions (OH-). Bronsted-Lowry acids are compounds that are proton donors. Bronsted-Lowry bases are compounds that are proton acceptors. Finally, Lewis acids are compounds that are electron pair acceptors, and Lewis bases are electron pair donors. </p> 			<h3> Strong vs Weak </h3>
		<p>	Strong acids are defined as dissociating completely in water. Weak acids don't. There are only six strong acids: </p>
	<ul>
	<li> HCl </li>
	<li> H(NO<sub>3</sub>) </li>
	<li> H2(SO<sub>4</sub>) </li>
	<li> HBr </li>
	<li> H(ClO<sub>4</sub>) </li>
	<li> HI </li>
	</ul>
	<p> 	However, there are too many weak acids to count. The number is in the hundreds. Similarly, for bases, there are eight strong bases and a multitude of weak bases. There is a simple trick to remember the eight strong bases: they all end with hydroxides, and it's either rows 2-6 in column 1 or rows 4-6 in column 2. In other words, it is:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> LiOH </li>
	<li> NaOH </li>
	<li> KOH </li>
	<li> RbOH </li>
	<li> CsOH </li>
	<li> Ca(OH)2 </li>
	<li> Sr(OH)2 </li>
	<li> Ba(OH)2 </li>
	</ul>
