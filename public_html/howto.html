I learned how to use these techniques from <b>CodeAcademy's</b> courses, particularly their Make a Website course. For the additional help I needed to visualize some Bootstrap concepts, I used an online resource called <b>w3schools</b>. I've attached buttons below to link to both of those resources. </p>
